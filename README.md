# CodeCanvas

## Description
CodeCanvas is a note taking and sharing program where programming students can share their notes with each other and add onto others by comments. This provides programming students with resources they can share with other students and helps them be able to get help outside of class. CodeCanvas utilizes Express.js, Express-Session, Handlebars.js, MySQL, and Sequelize to connect the user interface with a server and database.
